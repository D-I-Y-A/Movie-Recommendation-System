# Movie-Recommendation-System
Movie Recommendation System uses text analysis to suggest movies tailored to your preferences.
By analysing textual features like movie summaries, reviews, director, cast, crew, genre, and taglines,
the system generates tailored suggestions for users. With easy-to-understand algorithms, it matches
your tastes with movie details to give accurate suggestions. Additionally, the system allows users to
input specific actors and directors of interest to receive relevant suggestions. The system aims to
enhance user satisfaction and engagement by providing insightful and diverse movie recommendations
aligned with individual tastes and preferences.
